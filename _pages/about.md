Hello, welcome to my personal web home!

*I'm an **electrical engineer researcher in power management IC design**. I just got my Ph.D. Degree from the Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau in 2024. 

*My research work mainly focuses on high-efficiency, high-density power delivery architectures and circuits for electronic systems like humanoid robots and high-performance computing. I received the B.E. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2018 and the M.Sc. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2021. In the summer of 2024, I was a Visiting Scholar with the IMS-MX Group, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. 

I was awarded the SSCS Pre-doctoral Achievement 2024-2025, the Best Student Poster Award at PwrSoC 2023, the Best Oral Presentation Award of THU-UM sustainable innovation workshop 2023, Fudan University Excellent Academic Scholarship, and the University of Macau Ph.D. Assistantship. 

Ph.D. Thesis Title: Power Management IC design for high-performance computing and humanoid robots.

M.S.Thesis Title: Power management circuit IC design for wearable and portable devices.
