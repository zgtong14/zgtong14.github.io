Hello, welcome to my personal web home!

I'm an **electrical engineer researcher in power management IC design**. I just got my Ph.D. Degree from the Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau in 2024. 

My research work mainly focuses on **high-efficiency, high-density power delivery architectures and circuits for electronic systems like humanoid robots and high-performance computing**. I received the B.E. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2018 and the M.Sc. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2021. In the summer of 2024, I was a Visiting Scholar with the IMS-MX Group, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. 

I was awarded the **SSCS Pre-doctoral Achievement 2024-2025**, the Best Student Poster Award at PwrSoC 2023, the Best Oral Presentation Award of THU-UM sustainable innovation workshop 2023, Fudan University Excellent Academic Scholarship, and the University of Macau Ph.D. Assistantship. 

**Ph.D. Thesis Title: Power Management IC design for high-performance computing and humanoid robots.**

**M.S.Thesis Title: Power management circuit IC design for wearable and portable devices.**


Research Projects
======
* The thermal issue is the limiting factor for fast charging the compact portable devices. This Project presents a reconfigurable bidirectional
voltage-regulating cable which integrates a charging IC and all the associated passive components into the USB cable connector, and also is
capable of regulating a bidirectional step-down voltage. It achieves a peak power density of 3.17W/mm2 when transferring the maximum power of
42W, and the peak chip efficiency without the cable loss is 95.1% at 22.8W.

* This project presents a Charge-Pump-based SIMO (CPSIMO) buck-boost converter with three operation modes. By modifying the power stage topology of conventional SIMO buck-boost converters, the proposed converter exhibits faster transient response and higher efficiency. Moreover, an averagevoltage-based mode selector is introduced to implement the smooth transition between three modes. The proposed converter is designed in 0.18 μm BCD process with a supply voltage of 2.7V-4.2V and has three outputs of 1.8V, 3.3V and 5V. Simulation results show that the proposed converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94.61% under output power of 2.8W and a load transient response time of 9.9μs with a 1.5W power step.
