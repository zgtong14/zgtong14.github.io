title: "A 42W Reconfigurable Bidirectional Power Delivery Voltage-Regulating Cable"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'The thermal issue is the limiting factor for fast charging the compact portable devices. This paper presents a reconfigurable bidirectional voltage-regulating cable which integrates a charging IC and all the associated passive components into the USB cable connector, and also is capable of regulating a bidirectional step-down voltage. It achieves a peak power density of 3.17W/mm2 when transferring the maximum power of 42W, while the peak chip efficiency without the cable loss is 95.1% at 22.8W.'
